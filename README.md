# sass-starter
Boilerplate for Sass workflow

This is a boilerplate to quickly set up a workflow for Sass. It watches your files and builds and refreshes the page as you edit.

## Getting Started

Firstly, create a directory named after your project and cd to your newly created directory (folder).

`mkdir my-awesome-project`

`cd my-awesome-project`

Then, clone this repo to your current directory

`git clone git@github.com:nahinakbar/sass-starter.git . && rm -rf .git`

After you are done received the initial files,

`npm install`

Finally,

`npm start`
